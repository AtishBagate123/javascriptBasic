the window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals.
there time intervals are called timing events.
The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:

setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.

setInterval(function, milliseconds)
Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.
The setTimeout() and setInterval() are both methods of the HTML DOM Window object.
